## üéè Abstract
Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they <strong>a)</strong> operate independently without mutual interference and <strong>b)</strong> can be preserved to share with different modal inputs‚Äîboth aspects often neglected in existing methods. To address this gap, this paper proposes a novel <strong>E</strong>fficient <strong>D</strong>isentanglement framework for <strong>Talk</strong>ing head generation (<strong>EDTalk</strong>). Our framework enables individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, and emotional expression, conditioned on both video and audio inputs. Specifically, we employ three <strong>lightweight</strong> modules to decompose the facial dynamics into three distinct latent spaces representing mouth, pose, and expression, respectively. Each space is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce orthogonality among bases and devise an <strong>efficient</strong> training strategy to allocate motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge. The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each space, we propose Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of EDTalk.

<!-- Illustration of our proposed EDTalk. (a) EDTalk framework. Given an identity source $ I^i $ and various driving images $I^*$ ($ * \in \{m,p,e\} $) for controlling corresponding facial components, EDTalk animates the identity image $ I^i $ to mimic the mouth shape, head pose, and expression of $ I^m $, $ I^p $, and $ I^e $ with the assistance of three Component-aware Latent Navigation modules: MLN, PLN, and ELN.  (b) Efficient Disentanglement. The disentanglement process consists of two parts: Mouth-Pose decouple and Expression Decouple. For the former, we introduce the cross-reconstruction training strategy aimed at separating mouth shape and head pose. For the latter, we achieve expression disentanglement using self-reconstruction complementary learning. -->


## üî• Update
- 2024.07.19 - üíª Release data preprocess codes and partial training codes (fine-tuning LIA & Mouth-Pose Decouple & Audio2Mouth). But I'm busy now and don't have enough time to clean up all the codes, but I think the current codes can be a useful reference if ones want to reproduce EDTalk or other. If you run into any problems, feel free to propose an issue!
- 2024.07.01 - üíª The inference code and pretrained models are available.
- 2024.07.01 - üéâ Our paper is accepted by ECCV 2024.
- 2024.04.02 - üõ≥Ô∏è This repo is released.


## üìÖ TODO

- [ ] **Release training code.**
- [x] **Release inference code.**
- [x] **Release pre-trained models.**
- [x] **Release Arxiv paper.**


## üéÆ Installation
We train and test based on Python 3.8 and Pytorch. To install the dependencies run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tanshuai0219/EDTalk.git
cd EDTalk
```

### Install dependency
```
conda create -n EDTalk python=3.8
conda activate EDTalk
```

- python packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```




## üé¨ Quick Start

Download the [checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EKJXpq5gwFaRfkiAs6YUZ6YEiQ-8X3H3/view?usp=drive_link) and put them into ./ckpts.


### **EDTalk-A:lip+pose+exp**: Run the demo in audio-driven setting (EDTalk-A):
#### For user-friendliness, we extracted the weights of eight common sentiments in the expression base. one can directly specify the sentiment to generate emotional talking face videos (recommended)
  ```
  python demo_EDTalk_A_using_predefined_exp_weights.py --source_path path/to/image --audio_driving_path path/to/audio --pose_driving_path path/to/pose --exp_type type/of/expression --save_path path/to/save
  ```
  ****
#### Or you can input an expression reference (image/video) to indicate expression.

  ```
  python demo_EDTalk_A.py --source_path path/to/image --audio_driving_path path/to/audio --pose_driving_path path/to/pose --exp_driving_path path/to/expression --save_path path/to/save
  ```
  The result will be stored in save_path.

  **Source_path and videos used must be first cropped using scripts [crop_image2.py](data_preprocess/crop_image2.py) and [crop_video.py](data_preprocess/crop_video.py)**

  You can also use [crop_image.py](data_preprocess/crop_image.py) to crop the image, but [increase_ratio](https://github.com/tanshuai0219/EDTalk/blob/928fe3de7cf74b6a0e7db4ec90d59c85d79b8bc1/data_preprocess/crop_image.py#L76) has to be carefully set and tried several times to get the optimal result.
  <!-- For images where faces only make up a small portion of the image, we recommend using the [crop_image2.py](data_preprocess/crop_image2.py) to crop image. -->

****
### **EDTalk-A:lip+pose without exp**: If you don't want to change the expression of the identity source, please download the [EDTalk_lip_pose.pt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XkCWeph0LvQfpWb2mO4YhfUVE3qay71Z/view?usp=sharing) and put it into ./ckpts.

#### If you only want to change the lip motion of the identity source, run
  ```
   python demo_lip_pose.py --fix_pose --source_path path/to/image --audio_driving_path path/to/audio --save_path path/to/save
  ```
****
#### Or you can additionally control the head poses on top of the above via pose_driving_path
  ```
   python demo_lip_pose.py --source_path path/to/image --audio_driving_path path/to/audio --pose_driving_path path/to/pose --save_path path/to/save
  ```
****
### Run the demo in video-driven setting (EDTalk-V):
  ```
  python demo_EDTalk_V.py --source_path path/to/image --lip_driving_path path/to/lip --audio_driving_path path/to/audio --pose_driving_path path/to/pose --exp_driving_path path/to/expression --save_path path/to/save
  ```
  The result will be stored in save_path.


## üé¨ Data Preprocess for Training
**Note**: The functions provided are available, but one should adjust the way they are called, e.g. by modifying the path to the data. If you run into any problems, feel free to leave your problems!
- Download the MEAD and HDTF dataset:
1) **MEAD**. [download link](https://wywu.github.io/projects/MEAD/MEAD.html). 


    We only use *Front* videos and extract audios and orgnize the data as follows:

    ```text
    /dir_path/MEAD_front/
    |-- Original_video
    |   |-- M003#angry#level_1#001.mp4
    |   |-- M003#angry#level_1#002.mp4
    |   |-- ...
    |-- audio
    |   |-- M003#angry#level_1#001.wav
    |   |-- M003#angry#level_1#002.wav
    |   |-- ...
    ```


2) **HDTF**. [download link](https://github.com/MRzzm/HDTF).

    We orgnize the data as follows:

    ```text
    /dir_path/HDTF/
    |-- audios
    |   |-- RD_Radio1_000.wav
    |   |-- RD_Radio2_000.wav
    |   |-- ...
    |-- original_videos
    |   |-- RD_Radio1_000.mp4
    |   |-- RD_Radio2_000.mp4
    |   |-- ...
    ```

- Crop videos in training datasets:
    ```bash
    python data_preprocess/data_preprocess_for_train/crop_video_MEAD.py
    python data_preprocess/data_preprocess_for_train/crop_video_HDTF.py
    ```
- Split video: Since the video in HDTF is too long, we split both the video and the corresponding audio into 5s segments:
    ```bash
    python data_preprocess/data_preprocess_for_train/split_HDTF_video.py
    ```

    ```bash
    python data_preprocess/data_preprocess_for_train/split_HDTF_audio.py
    ```

- We save the video frames in a lmdb file to improve I/O efficiency:
    ```bash
    python data_preprocess/data_preprocess_for_train/prepare_lmdb.py
    ```

- Extract mel feature from audio:
    ```bash
    python data_preprocess/data_preprocess_for_train/get_mel.py
    ```
- Extract landmarks from cropped videos:
    ```bash
    python data_preprocess/data_preprocess_for_train/extract_lmdk.py
    ```
- Extract bboxs from cropped videos for lip discriminator using [extract_bbox.py](https://github.com/yuangan/EAT_code/blob/main/preprocess/extract_bbox.py) and we give an unclean example using lmdb like :
    ```bash
    python data_preprocess/data_preprocess_for_train/extract_bbox.py
    ```

- After the preprocessing, the data should be orgnized as follows:
    ```text
    /dir_path/MEAD_front/
    |-- Original_video
    |   |-- M003#angry#level_1#001.mp4
    |   |-- M003#angry#level_1#002.mp4
    |   |-- ...
    |-- video
    |   |-- M003#angry#level_1#001.mp4
    |   |-- M003#angry#level_1#002.mp4
    |   |-- ...
    |-- audio
    |   |-- M003#angry#level_1#001.wav
    |   |-- M003#angry#level_1#002.wav
    |   |-- ...

    |-- mel
    |   |-- M003#angry#level_1#001.npy
    |   |-- M003#angry#level_1#002.npy
    |   |-- ...

    /dir_path/HDTF/
    |-- split_5s_video

    |-- split_5s_audio
    |   |-- RD_Radio1_000#1.wav
    |   |-- RD_Radio1_000#2.wav
    |   |-- ...

    |   |-- RD_Radio1_000#1.npy
    |   |-- RD_Radio1_000#2.npy
    |   |-- ...
